# esbuild-nodemon

1. Bundle you NodeJS app with esbuild (without dependencies)
2. Run output by nodemon
3. Rebuild and restart on changes

## Use without installation

```bash
npx esbuild-nodemon src/server.ts
```

## Why

I want to build server using typescript with auto-restarts.
And I want it to start fast.
